	This exercise will teach you basic boolean operations in Python and how boolean expressions are evaluated.
	<hr>
    <i>Short circuit evaluation</i> occurs when the value of a boolean expression can be determined by its first
    arguement. In this case, The expression evaluates to the first arguement <b>without</b> evaluating the second arguement.<br>
    For example, <b>True or 1/0</b> evaluates to <b>True</b> in Python while <b>1/0 or True</b> will raise a <b>ZeroDivisionError</b>.
